  <h2>Robust Variance Estimation to Model Complex Meta-Analytic
Structures in the Immediate Antihypertensive Effects of Exercise</h2>
  <h3>Honors Undergraduate Thesis, University of Connecticut, June 2020</h1>
	<p>Objective: To determine and compare performance of the classical random effects
and Robust Variance Estimation meta-analysis methods among studies with dependencies
and moderators. We will apply these findings through the lens of the immediate blood
pressure response to exercise termed, postexercise hypotension (PEH) and provide
practical solutions for modeling common dependencies. Methods: Through the use of a
Monte Carlo simulation, we created several simulation scenarios modeling a variety of
common settings in PEH studies, including repeated measurements within the same
subject. We compared the estimation and inference results of the Robust Variance
Estimation (RVE) method to three variations of classical random effects meta-analysis and
meta-regression with a time moderator: average effect across all time points (“Average”),
one randomly selected observation (“Random”) across time points, and all observations
across all time points (“Naïve). Results: Overall, RVE method performs best in terms of: 1)
reducing bias of the overall and moderator effects; 2) correctly estimating coverage
probability containing the true effect; 3) having a high power in detecting a significant nonzero
overall or moderator effect; and 4) most accurately estimating the true t2 value. Under
a few specific simulation settings, the classical methods performed just as well as, or better
than the RVE method in some performance metrics when there was no time moderator
effect. Conclusions: The RVE method performs best overall across the simulation scenarios
considered and is recommended for PEH studies with time moderators and various levels
of dependencies of effect sizes, along with other types of studies.</p>
	

	
	
	
	<h2> Heart Rate Capabilities of Wrist Worn Monitors: A Time Series Analysis Approach</h2>
<h3>A Two Part Analysis on Model Comparison of Heart Rate across Single Aerobic Session and the
	Physiological Models between Eight Lagged Biometric Variables </h3>

	<p>In recent years, personal heart rate monitors have grown in popularity and are used anyone from
professional athletes to the average weekend warrior. Athletes in particular have begun to utilize
this technology to monitor their training and recovery status. These personal fitness tracking
devices can track many variables at any given moment, including biomarkers such as heart rate,
heart rate variability, heart rate zone, resting heart rate, as well as training characteristics such as
distance and pace, and sleep variables such as time spent in each sleep phase. In addition to
activity and biomarker tracking, many of the more sophisticated monitors are able to input the
data into a model or algorithm to provide a score that indicates how well the user recovered or
the strain of their training. This data can also be utilized to adjust the athletes training in order to
allow the athletes to recover and minimize risk of injury. Most of these heart rate monitors are
worn on the wrist or around the chest. However, “Convenience and comfort of the wrist-based
devices has enabled them to largely replace chest straps that employ electrodes that measure
cardiac electrical activity” (Pasadyn, 2019). The heart rate monitor worn on the chest has been
set as the gold standard for heart rate monitors and is used to determine the accuracy of wrist
worn monitors. Because the chest-worn heart rate monitors lack much of the sophistication and
ease that the wrist monitors have, recent studies have attempted to compare the accuracy of the
monitors. In this two-part analysis, I will (1) compare the heart rate capabilities of the Polar
Ignite and WHOOP 3.0 wrist worn fitness tracker during an aerobic training session using
ARIMA models, and (2) determine the physiological relationship between eight daily, lagged
variables collected by the WHOOP 3.0 over the course of one month, using the vector
		autoregression method (VAR). </p>
	
	
	
	<h2>Analysis of University of Connecticut Athletics Budget, 2015-2020</h2>
	
	<p>The goals of this indpendent project were to 1) analyze expenses and revenues of University of Connecticut (UConn) 
	Athletic Department from 2015 to 2020 in light of recent budget cuts, 2)to determine any possible discrepencies in fund 
	allocation between Men’s and Women’s teams, 3) to investigate trends of specific expenses by team and gender, and to 
	determine areas of significant increase, and 4) to determine any statistically significant relationship between revenue and 
		expense categories in an effort to increase revenue.</p>
