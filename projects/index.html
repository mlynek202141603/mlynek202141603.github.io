  <h2>Robust Variance Estimation to Model Complex Meta-Analytic
Structures in the Immediate Antihypertensive Effects of Exercise</h2>
  <h1>Honors Undergraduate Thesis, University of Connecticut, June 2020</h1>
	<p>Objective: To determine and compare performance of the classical random effects
and Robust Variance Estimation meta-analysis methods among studies with dependencies
and moderators. We will apply these findings through the lens of the immediate blood
pressure response to exercise termed, postexercise hypotension (PEH) and provide
practical solutions for modeling common dependencies. Methods: Through the use of a
Monte Carlo simulation, we created several simulation scenarios modeling a variety of
common settings in PEH studies, including repeated measurements within the same
subject. We compared the estimation and inference results of the Robust Variance
Estimation (RVE) method to three variations of classical random effects meta-analysis and
meta-regression with a time moderator: average effect across all time points (“Average”),
one randomly selected observation (“Random”) across time points, and all observations
across all time points (“Naïve). Results: Overall, RVE method performs best in terms of: 1)
reducing bias of the overall and moderator effects; 2) correctly estimating coverage
probability containing the true effect; 3) having a high power in detecting a significant nonzero
overall or moderator effect; and 4) most accurately estimating the true t2 value. Under
a few specific simulation settings, the classical methods performed just as well as, or better
than the RVE method in some performance metrics when there was no time moderator
effect. Conclusions: The RVE method performs best overall across the simulation scenarios
considered and is recommended for PEH studies with time moderators and various levels
of dependencies of effect sizes, along with other types of studies.</p>
