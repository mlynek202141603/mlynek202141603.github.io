	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am currently studying statistical analysis and programming at the London School of Economics and Political Science in the 
		MSc Health Data Science programme. I completed my BS in Statistics with a minor in Geographic Information Science from the 
		University of Connecticut in May 2020. I have experience in data analytics and visualization, meta-analysis, biostatistics, 
		time series analysis, spatial analysis, as well strong technical skills in R, SAS, SPSS and GIS. This year, I hope to gain 
		practical experience in Python through my coursework and participation
		in the LSESU Data Science Society. In the near future, I plan to pursue a career in statistical consulting and am looking forward 
		to working on a variety of analysis projects.</p>
	
	<p> In my free time, I enjoy exploring London, hiking, rowing, fencing and studying the Czech language. </p>
